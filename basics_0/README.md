# Networking Basics #0

## What I Learned

- **OSI Model**: 7-layer networking model that organizes how data travels across networks
- **Network Types**: LAN (local networks), WAN (wide area networks), and the Internet
- **IP Addressing**: IPv4 vs IPv6, localhost (127.0.0.1), and subnets
- **Protocols**: TCP (reliable) vs UDP (fast), and their use cases
- **Ports**: How services use ports (SSH:22, HTTP:80, HTTPS:443)
- **Network Tools**: Using ping and netstat to check connectivity and ports
