# Networking Basics #1

## What I Learned

- **localhost (127.0.0.1)**: The loopback address that refers to your own computer
- **0.0.0.0**: Special address meaning "all interfaces" or "any address"
- **/etc/hosts file**: Local DNS file for mapping hostnames to IP addresses
- **Network interfaces**: How to display all active IPs on a machine
- **netcat (nc)**: Tool for creating network connections and listening on ports

## Tasks

**0-change_your_home_IP** - Modify /etc/hosts to change localhost to 127.0.0.2
**1-show_attached_IPs** - Display all active IPv4 addresses on the machine
**2-port_listening_on_localhost** - Listen on port 98 using netcat
