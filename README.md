## Projects

### Networking Basics #0

This project covers fundamental networking concepts including the OSI model, network types, protocols, and basic network diagnostic tools.

#### Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to explain:

**OSI Model:**
- What the OSI model is
- How many layers it has
- How it is organized

**Network Types:**
- What is a LAN (Local Area Network)
- Typical LAN usage and geographical size
- What is a WAN (Wide Area Network)
- Typical WAN usage and geographical size
- What is the Internet

**IP Addressing:**
- What is an IP address
- The 2 types of IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
- What is localhost
- What is a subnet
- Why IPv6 was created

**TCP/UDP:**
- The 2 main data transfer protocols for IP
- Main difference between TCP and UDP
- What is a port
- SSH (22), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443) port numbers
- Tools/protocols used to check network connectivity

#### Directory: basics_0

Contains answer files and bash scripts for the following tasks:

**Task 0: OSI model** (`0-OSI_model`)
- Multiple choice questions about the OSI model concept and organization

**Task 1: Types of network** (`1-types_of_network`)
- Questions about LAN, WAN, and Internet network types

**Task 2: MAC and IP address** (`2-MAC_and_IP_address`)
- Questions about MAC and IP address definitions

**Task 3: UDP and TCP** (`3-UDP_and_TCP`)
- Questions about TCP and UDP protocol characteristics

**Task 4: TCP and UDP ports** (`4-TCP_and_UDP_ports`)
- Bash script that displays listening ports with PID and program names
- Usage: `sudo ./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports`

**Task 5: Is the host on the network** (`5-is_the_host_on_the_network`)
- Bash script that pings an IP address 5 times
- Usage: `./5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}`

#### Requirements

**Bash Scripts:**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted on Ubuntu 22.04
- All files end with a new line
- All bash scripts are executable
- First line: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Second line: Comment explaining the script's purpose
- Scripts must pass shellcheck without errors

**Answer Files:**
- Each answer on a new line
- Numeric answers for multiple choice questions
